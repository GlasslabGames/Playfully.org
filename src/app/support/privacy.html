      <p>
        We take great pride in our relationship with you. As such, we are dedicated
        to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information we obtain
        from you with care and respect. This Children&rsquo;s Privacy Policy is
        designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy policies and 
        principles with respect to children under the age of 13 (each a
        &ldquo;child&rdquo; and collectively, &ldquo;children.&rdquo;)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Building on our general Privacy Policy, we recognize the need to provide
        additional privacy protections when children visit the sites on which
        this Children&rsquo;s Privacy Policy is posted (&ldquo;Sites&rdquo;). We
        explain those additional protections here in this Children&rsquo;s Privacy
        Policy. For your convenience, this Children&rsquo;s Privacy Policy uses
        terms that are defined in our general Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (&ldquo;COPPA&rdquo;)
        requires that we inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect,
        use, and disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age;
        that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for children
        under 13 years of age to use certain features of our web sites; and that we
        provide parents access to their child&rsquo;s personal information to review
        and/or have the information deleted. Below we explain how we do this for
        children. Also, when we use the term &ldquo;parent&rdquo; below, we mean
        to include legal guardians.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our Site provides two ways for children to access and use the products and
        services made available on, by or through our Site, including all games and
        learning tools (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;). The first is when the parent
        registers for the Services for use by their child(ren). The second is when
        a teacher registers for the Services for use by their students. When we
        use the term &ldquo;teacher&rdquo; below we mean to also include
        administrators of the school, district or classroom. If you are not of legal
        age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18), you
        may only use the Services and disclose information to us with your
        parent&rsquo;s express consent. Please review this Children&rsquo;s Privacy
        Policy, our general Privacy Policy and our Terms and Conditions Agreement
        with your parent.

            What types of personal information do we collect about children?
          </h3>
          <p>
            In order for a child to use our Services, the parent or teacher must
            register the child and obtain a Class Code. In the registration process,
            the parent or teacher will be asked to provide information about him or
            herself, including the parent&rsquo;s or teacher&rsquo;s name, email
            address, grade level(s) of the child(ren)/students, and the name of the
            institution (school or district) where the teacher works. Children do
            not provide or disclose any personal information on our Site. In certain
            cases, we also may collect a child&rsquo;s e-mail address from a parent
            or teacher for the purpose of sending the child e-mail related to
            his/her registration and for customer support. Providing a child&rsquo;s
            email is optional. We may collect additional personal information from
            parents and teachers in order to allow the child to participate in
            certain features located on our Site.

            How do we use and share the personally identifiable information we
            have collected about children?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Personal information regarding a child may be collected and used to
            enable a child&rsquo;s registration for the Services, to personalize
            communications to a child regarding a specific game, learning tool or
            newsletter. Their personal information may also be used for assessment
            purposes in the game or learning tool and will not be shared with any
            third parties except for the group or school under which they registered.
            Some interactive activities may involve disclosure of a child&rsquo;s
            personal information to third parties and our partners and operators.
            In addition, we may share a child&rsquo;s personal information with
            third parties to the extent reasonabl necessary to: protect the security
            of integrity of our sites; to take precautions against liability; to
            respond to judicial process; or to the extent permitted under provisions
            of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an
            investigation related to public safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to disclosing any personal information regarding a child with any
            third party operators or service providers, we receive representations
            from them that their privacy policies are COPPA compliant. We
            periodically request re-verification of this.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a child who is signed up for the Services and has a Class
            Code, you understand that your parent and/or teacher can view all 
            information and activity within or associated with your account, 
            including, without limitation, all personal information, any messages
            between you and your teacher and grades and assessment you receive on
            projects.

            How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of
            information from their children?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We only collect personal information from a child where that
            child&rsquo;s parent or teacher has agreed to the terms of Services via
            the End User License Agreement and (a) in the case of a parent, has
            provided consent for the child to use the Services and to provide
            personal information to us. To use and access our Services, the parent
            or teacher must first register the child and obtain a Class Code for
            their child or students. Childen are not allowed to self-register or
            initiate the registration process or to access the Services prior to
            the parent&rsquo;s registration of his/her account and consent to our
            Site&rsquo;s Terms and Conditions Agreement. Once the parent/teacher is
            registered, the parent or teacher will receive a Class Code and with
            that code the child will be able to use the Services including viewing
            content, playing games, using our learning tools and participating in
            the learning activities for which their Class Code applies.
