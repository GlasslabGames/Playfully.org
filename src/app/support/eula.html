Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of Licensor. The terms of the License will govern any upgrades provided by Licensor that replace and/or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.</p>
      <br />

      <strong>Use of Data.</strong>

      <p>Use of the Licensed Application may require the creation of a user-profile, which from time-to-time, may ask for name, address, e-mail, phone, address and other personally identifiable information. Use of the Licensed Application will further result in the generation of (i) certain user-generated content, and (ii) technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about Your device, system and application software, and peripherals (collectively with personally identifiable information, the &ldquo;Application Data&rdquo;). You agree that Licensor may collect and use Application Data to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to You (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify You, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to You.</p>
      <br />

      <strong>Termination and Amendments.</strong>

      <p>The license is effective until terminated by You or Licensor.

Upon termination of the license, You shall cease all use of the Licensed Application, and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Licensed Application.

If You do not accept the amendment, this License shall automatically terminate and You shall cease all use of the Licensed Application, and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Licensed Application. If, within 30-days of the Licensor&rsquo;s notice to You of the amendment, You continue to use the Licensed Application, Your continued use will be deemed acceptance of the amendment.</p>
      <br />

      <strong>Third Party Materials.</strong>

      <p>The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor&rsquo;s and third party content, services and web sites (collectively and individually, &quot;Services&quot;).  You understand that by using any of the Services, You may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may be identified as having explicit language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. You agree to use the Services at Your sole risk and that the Licensor shall not have any liability to You for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.</p>

      <p>Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or materials from third parties (&ldquo;Third Party Materials&rdquo;) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By using the Services, You acknowledge and agree that the Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites. Licensor does not warrant or endorse and does not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to You or any other person for any third-party Services, Third Party Materials or web sites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other web sites are provided solely as a convenience to You. Location data provided by any Services is for basic navigational purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Neither Licensor, nor any of its content providers, guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data displayed by any Services.</p>

      <p>You agree that any Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright and trademark, and that You will not use such proprietary content, information or materials in any way whatsoever except for permitted use of the Services. No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and You shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, or otherwise post obscene or objectionable content, or content containing nudity and/or pornography, and that the Licensor is not in any way responsible for any such use by You, nor for any harassing, threatening, objectionable, obscene, pornographic, defamatory, offensive or illegal messages or transmissions that You may receive as a result of using any of the Services. You acknowledge that Your breach of this section may result in immediate termination of Your account and/or being blocked from the Licensed Application.</p>

      <p>Licensor makes no representation that the Services and Third Party Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent You choose to access such Services or Third Party Materials, You do so at Your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Licensor be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. Licensor may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.</p>

      <p>If You encounter any Services You deem objectionable, offensive, indecent and/or illegal (&ldquo;Objectionable Material&rdquo;), You should provide notification to Licensor of the Objectionable Material by contacting Licensor at <a href="mailto:support@glasslabgames.org">support@glasslabgames.org</a>. As an alternative means of providing Licensor notice of Objectionable Material, Licensor may also provide a mechanism within the Licensed Application for you to &ldquo;flag&rdquo; any Services you deem Objectionable Material. Licensor will review the Objectionable Material, and if, in Licensor&rsquo;s sole discretion, it finds the Objectionable Materials inappropriate for the Licensed Application, Licensor will take reasonable steps to remove and/or shield the Objectionable Material from You and potentially other users of the Licensed Application. </p>
