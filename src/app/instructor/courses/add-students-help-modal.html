        name that may be taken by another student on Glasslab Games, however, you can create a special naming convention
        for your Class. For instance, if your name is Liz Kline and you want to bulk roster your 3rd Period Science
        students, you can use "LK3Science1, LK3Science2, LK3Science3..." and so on!</td>

        6 characters, with at least 1 capital letter and 1 number. Please feel free to create a standard password that is
        easy to write down and remember, like "MsKline123" or "Myscienceclass1", and suggest your students change their
        own passwords once they've logged in.</td>
