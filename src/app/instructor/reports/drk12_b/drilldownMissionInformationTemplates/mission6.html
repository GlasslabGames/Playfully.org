<p style="font-weight: bold">Mission 6: Helpbots</p>
<div>Help Lucas find out whether or not Helpbots can understand the human language.</div>
<div>Find <strong>evidence</strong> and make a <strong>strong argument</strong> for one of the following claims:
    <ul>
        <li>Stop trying to figure out if help-bots understand us</li>
        <li>Yes. The engineers' new helpbots can understand language</li>
        <li>or The engineers' new helpbots can't really understand what we say.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Our AUTHORITY on language said help-bots understand most everything we say.</li>
    <li>EXPERT machine language scientists say newer robots understand all human language.</li>
    <li>Ann Arc OBSERVED a help-bot giving directions after she asked it how to get to the bank.</li>
    <li>One student OBSERVED her new help-bot read and shop for everything on her grocery list.</li>
    <li>Academy EXPERTS say robots understand people about as well as a piece of toast.</li>
    <li>Marta OBSERVED a help-bot punch someone who asked for a sock.</li>
    <li>The EXPERT Committee on Languages decided robots will never understand what they say.</li>
    <li>A worker SAW a help-bot bring an old band-aid after being asked for a piece of tape.</li>
    <li>Many EXPERT programmers say it doesn't matter if help-bots really understand us or not.</li>
    <li>IF we stopped investigating whether help-bots understand us, THEN we could solve other problems.</li>
    <li>IF we stopped researching what help-bots understand, THEN we'd have more time for other projects.</li>
    <li>A leading research EXPERT says we should stop trying to understand if help-bots understand us.</li>
    <li>IF we stopped debating how many help-bots to make, THEN we could talk about more important things.</li>
    <li>AUTHORITIES of the Talk Show Association claim bots on their talk shows understand us.</li>
    <li>Some Academy language EXPERTS think it's impossible for robots to understand us.</li>
    <li>One engineer OBSERVED that her help-bot understands 100% of what she says.</li>
    <li>The cafeteria manager OBSERVED a help-bot bring noodles when asked for soy milk.</li>
    <li>Engineer Marna Loop, an AUTHORITY on robots, says they follow 96% of our commands.</li>
    <li>A help-bot was OBSERVED washing the trash when asked to make lunch.</li>
    <li>Computer EXPERTS say we should stop researching how much help-bots understand.</li>
    <li>The Academy EXPERT on manners says to thank robots just like we would a human.</li>
    <li>IF help-bots can't navigate, THEN it's risky to rely on them in emergencies.</li>
    <li>One CONSEQUENCE of using help-bots is you can get more done.</li>
    <li>One engineer OBSERVED help-bots run for twelve hours without a recharge.</li>
