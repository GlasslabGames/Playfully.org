    <li>Kara Tram - EXPERT in training engineers - says Lucas should stay on Mars but leave his position.</li>
    <li>JR Coop is an authority on security and says Lucas should have to take a different position on Mars.</li>
    <li>El Hartfelt is an EXPERT in space law and she says Lucas should be returned to Earth.</li>
    <li>Al Clive is an AUTHORITY on robots and says we should reward Lucas.</li>
    <li>Lon Channi is an EXPERT. He says Lucas understands robots and should be rewarded.</li>
    <li>Destroying valuable equipment to save a robot IS LIKE throwing away old chewing gum.</li>
    <li>Lucas is JUST LIKE animal rights activists that were rewarded for saving animals on Earth.</li>
    <li>IF Lucas has to take a different position in the settlement, THEN others won't break the rules.</li>
    <li>A CONSEQUENCE of Lucas changing his position is others will know they should not take risks just to save robots.</li>
    <li>A CONSEQUENCE of sending Lucas to Earth is he won't cause any more trouble here.</li>
    <li>A CONSEQUENCE of returning Lucas to Earth is others won't take risks to save robots.</li>
    <li>One CONSEQUENCE of rewarding Lucas is others will take better care of robots.</li>
    <li>IF Lucas is rewarded for his commitment, THEN people will understand robots have feelings too.</li>
    <li>One CONSEQUENCE of rewarding Lucas is it's the ONLY decision people will agree with.</li>
    <li>The security team OBSERVED Lucas leave the city with his shoes untied.</li>
    <li>The guard on duty SAW Lucas getting tools and a suit from the supply room.</li>
    <li>Other engineers OBSERVED that no one is as committed to the robots than Lucas.</li>
