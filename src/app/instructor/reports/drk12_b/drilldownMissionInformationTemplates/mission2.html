    <li>EXPERT scientists say insects are the BEST protein source for life on Mars.</li>
    <li>Hale Ferrus, an EXPERT geologist, says iron in the soil makes Mars look red.</li>
    <li>Jebb Ale, a fish EXPERT, says raising fish is our ONLY good choice for our protein source.</li>
    <li>Our AUTHORITY on food strategy says soy is the ONLY right solution to our protein needs.</li>
    <li>One of our RESPECTED chefs, Jay Ngian, says turtle soup is best served cold.</li>
    <li>Mrs. Eerie is an AUTHORITY on food sources. She says the only sensible idea is to raise insects!</li>
    <li>Arni Pez, a Tofu Kung Fu cookoff EXPERT, says soy is the ONLY logical protein source.</li>
    <li>Dr. Peshe is a health food EXPERT. She thinks our ONE protein source should be fish.</li>
    <li>Our AUTHORITY in nutrition says we should ONLY raise fish for protein.</li>
    <li>A CONSEQUENCE of using soy beans is they can make fake meat products and ice cream healthier.</li>
    <li>A good CONSEQUENCE of using insects for protein is we'll save space.</li>
    <li>IF we raise fish for protein, THEN we can use their bones to fertilize our soil.</li>
    <li>IF we use fish, a CONSEQUENCE will be allergic reactions for some people.</li>
    <li>Cooking school chefs OBSERVED crickets shed their exoskeletons.</li>
    <li>People have OBSERVED that insects have what is called a compound eye.</li>
