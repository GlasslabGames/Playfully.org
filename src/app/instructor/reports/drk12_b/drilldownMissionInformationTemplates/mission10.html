<div>Help Dara decide what Brackett City needs to prioritize next: community, maintenance, or research.</div>
<div>Find <strong>evidence</strong> and make a <strong>strong argument</strong> for one of the following claims:
    <ul>
        <li>Brackett City needs to prioritize community</li>
        <li>Brackett City needs to prioritize maintenance</li>
        <li>or Brackett City needs to prioritize research.</li>

    <li>According to our mechanics' OBSERVATIONS, half of our filters have broken parts.</li>
    <li>One engineer OBSERVED our water pumps are clogged and working poorly.</li>
    <li>Ed Clensail is our maintenance AUTHORITY. He says we need 30% more time to maintain our equipment.</li>
    <li>Anne Topwrench is an engineering AUTHORITY. She says maintenance should be our ONLY priority.</li>
    <li>One CONSEQUENCE of maintaining our equipment is that it will last longer.</li>
    <li>As a CONSEQUENCE of maintaining our equipment, we'll spend less time replacing it later.</li>
    <li>Maintaining equipment is JUST LIKE exercising our bodies - if we take care of the equipment, it will work better.</li>
    <li>Our OBSERVATIONS show there are many important research questions that need to be answered.</li>
    <li>Gale Tuhmara is an AUTHORITY on space travel, and says we should ONLY focus on research.</li>
    <li>Alex Sourwind - AUTHORITY on scientific research - said our first priority should be doing research on how to live on Mars.</li>
    <li>As a CONSEQUENCE of doing more research, we'll be able to make the city safer for people.</li>
    <li>A good CONSEQUENCE of doing more research is that we'll learn more about living on Mars.</li>
    <li>Doing more research can be COMPARED to emergency planning - it helps us prepare better for living on Mars.</li>
    <li>Residents OBSERVED they feel more at home on Mars when they spend time getting to know each other.</li>
    <li>Steve Costa - AUTHORITY on community living - says we ought to spend our time getting to know each other.</li>
    <li>Fran Mor, AUTHORITY on friendship, claims our first priority should be getting to know each other better.</li>
    <li>One good CONSEQUENCE of spending more time together is that we'll all get along better.</li>
    <li>A CONSEQUENCE of spending more time together is that people will work better as a team.</li>
    <li>Creating stronger community is COMPARABLE to learning a new language - people get closer by being together and talking.</li>
    <li>IF we do more research, THEN we'll be able to make our city on Mars safer.</li>
