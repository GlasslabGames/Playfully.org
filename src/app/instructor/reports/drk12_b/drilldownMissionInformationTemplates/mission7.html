<div>Lucas asks for your help to save the life of a helpbot that broke outside its programming and saved an engineer's life.</div>
<div>Find <span class="gl-drk12-bold">evidence</span> and make a <span class="gl-drk12-bold">strong argument</span> for one of the following claims:
    <ul>
        <li>Ike the rescubot is a hero, honor the robot</li>
        <li>Reprogram Ike the rescubot</li>
        <li>or Redesign all the rescubots!</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Al Clive is an AUTHORITY on robots and says we should treat robot Ike like a hero.</li>
    <li>The robotics software EXPERT says Ike just needs to be reprogrammed.</li>
    <li>Jane Lo, EXPERT Chief of Robotics, says reprogramming Ike is all that needs to happen.</li>
    <li>Our robotics AUTHORITY - Dr. Lo - said to redesign all rescubots.</li>
    <li>Ike acted JUST LIKE human heroes - he faced risks to save others.</li>
    <li>Reprogramming robots is JUST LIKE reminding people of the rules - both people and robots need to be reminded.</li>
    <li>Redesigning the bots IS JUST LIKE getting a car a new engine, they run like new.</li>
    <li>IF we make robot Ike a hero, THEN more kids will get interested in robotics.</li>
    <li>A CONSEQUENCE of making Ike the robot a hero is engineers will build better robots.</li>
    <li>One CONSEQUENCE of reprogramming Ike is that he won't malfunction that way again.</li>
    <li>A CONSEQUENCE of just reprogramming Ike is we'll have another working rescubot.</li>
    <li>IF we redesign all rescubots, THEN they'll all get needed updates.</li>
    <li>OBSERVATIONS of the robot's records SHOW it acted like a hero to save the engineers' lives.</li>
    <li>OBSERVATIONS SHOW the robot knowingly faced dangerous radiation so he could save the engineers.</li>
    <li>OBSERVATIONS showed the robot's programs malfuctioned when he saved the engineers.</li>
    <li>One rescubot manager OBSERVED the rescubots were poorly designed.</li>
