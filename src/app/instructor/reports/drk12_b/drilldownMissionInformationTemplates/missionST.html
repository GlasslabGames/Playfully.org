    <li>One researcher OBSERVED people were happier when they played board games together.</li>
    <li>A CONSEQUENCE of playing games together is that people will become friends.</li>
    <li>Improved moods will be one CONSEQUENCE of holding a checker contest.</li>
    <li>Our AUTHORITY on healthy competition says checker contests are the best way to go.</li>
    <li>OBSERVERS found people have the most fun competing in checkers.</li>
    <li>One CONSEQUENCE of competing in checkers is improved strategic thinking.</li>
    <li>Brackett City's AUTHORITY on water says we should limit the amount of water people can use.</li>
    <li>Our OBSERVATIONS show people waste less water when they have a limited amount they can use.</li>
    <li>One CONSEQUENCE of limiting the amount of water people use is we'll be less likely to run out of it.</li>
    <li>The Health and Safety AUTHORITY claims people should use less water.</li>
    <li>Routine OBSERVATIONS show Brackett City is running low on water.</li>
    <li>Brackett-City can create an emergency water supply as a CONSEQUENCE of limiting people's water use.</li>
    <li>The conservation AUTHORITY says we should cut people's water use by one half.</li>
    <li>A CONSEQUENCE of limiting water use is we'll have more water to use for plant research.</li>
    <li>The Bracket City AUTHORITY on happy living says we should learn to make artificial versions of popular foods.</li>
    <li>Several OBSERVATIONS show people feel better when they have things that remind them of home.</li>
    <li>A CONSEQUENCE of making artificial peanut butter and jelly sandwiches is that people will feel less homesick for Earth.</li>
    <li>The Society of Sandwich AUTHORITIES claim researchers should find ways to make PB&J on Mars.</li>
    <li>Several reports have OBSERVED people asking for peanut butter and jelly at the local deli.</li>
    <li>A CONSEQUENCE of inventing artificial peanut butter and jelly sandiwches is that even kids with peanut allergies will be able to eat them.</li>
    <li>AUTHORITIES at the Good Lunch Association say making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on Mars should be our top research goal.</li>
    <li>The women's bowling champions OBSERVED local bowlers wishing they had peanut butter and jelly to put on their bread.</li>
    <li>If we can invent a way to make peanut butter and jelly on Mars, a CONSEQUENCE will be happier kids.</li>
    <li>Our community living EXPERT claims people in Brackett City need more privacy and space.</li>
    <li>One Brackett City resident SAW people were less tense when they had places to be alone.</li>
    <li>Brackett City EXPERTS say people need more living spaces where they can have privacy.</li>
    <li>Researchers have HEARD that people need 1.2 square feet more room than they now have at Brackett City.</li>
    <li>IF there is more living space in Brackett City, THEN there will be fewer arguments.</li>
    <li>Reporters have SEEN many people getting upset because Brackett City is so crowded.</li>
    <li>Alex Parlar - a technology EXPERT - wants to replace the broken satellites we use to send messages.</li>
    <li>One engineer SAW that our satellite signals from Earth are half as strong as they used to be.</li>
    <li>IF we create more living space in Brackett City, THEN we could have more people living here.</li>
    <li>Engineers have WITNESSED many parts fail on our old satellites.</li>
    <li>WITH newer satellites THEN we'll be able to send and receive messages to Earth faster.</li>
    <li>We have SEEN evidence of slower communications using our older satellites.</li>
    <li>Only IF we build faster satellites will we THEN be able to have clearer communication with Earth.</li>
    <li>A reporter HEARD several people saying they were upset that some people got more water than they did.</li>
    <li>IF everyone gets equal resources on Mars, THEN there will be fewer arguments.</li>
    <li>Several people SAW arguments break out becuse someone got more food than they did.</li>
    <li>People with the MOST EXPERIENCE claim we should all be treated the same.</li>
    <li>IF everyone gets the same amount of money and materials, THEN they will feel more secure living in Brackett City.</li>
    <li>The City's Director of Energy is sure we'll soon have an energy shortage and that we need more power.</li>
    <li>Looking at the city's solar panels it is clear they make less energy than they used to.</li>
    <li>Researchers have seen several labs have to stop working because of a lack of power.</li>
    <li>With more electricity, we'll be able to run our research labs seven days per week.</li>
    <li>"The city will need to double its electricity output by next year!" said the head electrician.</li>
    <li>Several residents have seen their neighbors shut off their lights so they would have more power on the weekend.</li>
    <li>A result of not creating more electricity will be that we can no longer let people run their lights at night.</li>
    <li>Workers saw that the solar panels make only a fraction of the electricity the city needs during certain months of the year.</li>
    <li>With new sources of electricity, the city would be able to grow.</li>
    <li>During dust storms mechanics saw the solar panels generate only half the electricity they usually make.</li>
    <li>Life in Brackett City will be more secure with many sources of electricity.</li>
    <li>Our equipment manager is well respected and believes city residents do not spend enough time maintaining equipment.</li>
    <li>Several engineers have seen equipment failures that could have been avoided with the right maintenance.</li>
    <li>The most experienced mechanics believe we need to double the time spent caring for Brackett City's equipment.</li>
    <li>Our most respected engineers claim the city's equipment will need at least 1,000 hours of work to get them back into top condition.</li>
    <li>When more care is taken to fix the city's equipment, then people will feel safer.</li>
    <li>Checker contests are COMPARABLE to sports tournaments, they bring people together.</li>
    <li>Checker contests can be COMPARED to birthday parties - both are good places to make friends.</li>
    <li>Limiting the water people use can be COMPARED to putting money in the bank.</li>
    <li>Being able to get PB&J on Mars can be COMPARED to giving people a week's vacation on Earth.</li>
    <li>Having enough space is JUST LIKE having enough air to breathe - both are necessary.</li>
    <li>Our need for space IS THE SAME AS our need for food and water - we can't live without them.</li>
    <li>Not giving people enough space IS A LOT LIKE putting them in prison.</li>
    <li>Having more satellites will be JUST LIKE we're living on Earth again.</li>
    <li>Having more satellites would be LIKE moving Earth closer to Mars.</li>
    <li>Having more satellites would make communications on Mars JUST LIKE they are on Earth.</li>
    <li>Sharing resources equally is JUST LIKE being in a family.</li>
    <li>Being sure everyone has the same resources is the SAME AS giving people a fair share.</li>
    <li>When people don't have equal resources, it's THE SAME AS saying some people deserve more than others.</li>
    <li>Making more energy and friends are similar because you can never have too many friends.</li>
    <li>Having more electricity will feel like we have more robots around because we'll get more done.</li>
    <li>Having too little electricity is the same as living in the dark ages.</li>
    <li>Solar panels are similar to submarines - they only work in some environments.</li>
    <li>Depending on our solar panels is like having to rely on an old car - you can never be sure of when it will work.</li>
    <li>Having other sources of power is the same as having a security blanket - we'll feel safer.</li>
