            Argumentation learning trajectory skills
            <br/>Gameplay in Mars Generation One is based on four skills in an argumentation learning trajectory:
            <ol>
                <li>Connecting Evidence to Argument Schemes: A student should be able to construct a valid argument by using evidence that is appropriate to an argumentation scheme.</li>
                <li>Supporting Claims with Relevant and Non-Contradictory Evidence: A student should be able to construct a valid argument by using evidence that is relevant to a claim and that does not contradict it.</li>
                <li>Using Critical Questions: Based on an understanding of the relationship between “type of evidence” and “argument schemes,” a student should be able to use appropriate questions to probe for weaknesses in an opponent’s evidence (i.e., there is insufficient backing to strengthen the evidence—therefore, the argument is weakened). Similarly, a student should be able to ask these questions of their own evidence and determine whether it is strong enough to support their argument.</li>
                <li>Using Backing to Strengthen an Argument: robot in a duel), then the evidence must be from an authority, such as an expert, in order for the argument to be valid.</li>
            </ol>
            <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            What data are available about these skills?
            <br/>For the Whole Class:
            <ul>
                <li>A green circle means that, for ALL STUDENTS, your students are averaging a 70% or higher success rate on this skill.</li>
                <li>A yellow circle means that, for ALL STUDENTS, your students are averaging below a 70% success rate on this skill.</li>
            </ul>
            For the Student Roster:
            <ul>
                <li>A green circle means that AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT completed a mission with a 70% or higher success rate on a particular skill.</li>
                <li>A yellow circle means that AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT has completed a mission below a 70% success rate on a particular skill.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            What can you infer about student learning?
            <ul>
                <li>A high percentage of correct attempts (70% or more) suggests that a student(s) (or a majority of your students) has at least some understanding of how to apply this skill in the game.</li>
                <li>A lower percentage of correct attempts (less than 70%) suggests that a student(s) might be struggling to apply this skill in the game.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
        </li>
        <li>
            Assumptions to check on after reviewing the data
            <ol>
                <li>Connecting Evidence to Argument Schemes: Some students might be adept at focusing on keywords within a piece of evidence (such as “expert” in a piece of evidence that supports an argument from authority, or an “if…then” statement in a piece of evidence that supports an argument from consequences, for example) without necessarily understanding the differences between argument schemes. Consider asking a student or students to give you examples of each argument type, in their own words, and explain the difference to you.</li>
                <li>Supporting Claims with Relevant and Non-Contradictory Evidence: Consider asking a student or students to ask the following set of questions about a piece of evidence (with you or a peer): (1) Is this evidence about the same the same topic as my claim? (2) What word or words show that the evidence is about the same topic (or, is not about the same topic)? (3) Does this piece of evidence weaken or go against my claim in any way? (4) What word or words show that the evidence weakens (or strengthens) my claim? If a student answers “No” to #1 or “Yes” to #3 then he or she most likely does not have a strong piece of evidence to support the claim.</li>
                <li>Using Critical Questions: Similar to #1 above, students might be adept at focusing on keywords without necessarily understanding that the form a critical question takes depends on the argument scheme that he or she is using (or that an opponent is using). Consider asking a student or students to brainstorm one or two of their own critical questions and then explain why those are good critical questions for a particular argument scheme. Or, have them explain why existing critical questions from the game are appropriate (or inappropriate) for an argument scheme.</li>
                <li>Using Backing to Strengthen an Argument: Students might assume that “quantity counts” when using the game’s “Backing Generator.” For any given piece of evidence that a student intends to use in a duel, consider asking a student or students to review each piece of backing (assuming the student has run the evidence through the Generator) and explain how it strengthens or weakens an argument. For backing that weakens an argument, have students explain one or two ways that other backing would strengthen the evidence (and therefore the argument).</li>
