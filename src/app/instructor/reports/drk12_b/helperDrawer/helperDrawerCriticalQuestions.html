            <h3>What are the learning goals for "asking critical questions"?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Students are able to ask appropriate critical questions based on an opponent's argument scheme</li>
                <li>Students are able to ask critical questions to look for weaknesses in an argument based on the use of poorly-backed evidence</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What are critical questions and why ask them?</h3>
            <p>Just because an argument uses evidence that is relevant and supports a claim, it doesn't necessarily mean that it uses <em>strong evidence</em>. For example, evidence from authority can support the claim, but if the person cited isn't actually an authority on the subject, then that wouldn't be strong evidence. Asking critical questions helps to evaluate the strength of an argument—either your own or someone else's. Every argument scheme has its own related critical questions. By asking critical questions (and getting answers), an arguer can determine how well-justified a claim is by looking for weaknesses. Here are some examples of critical questions for the four argument schemes in the game.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Argument from Authority:</strong>
                    Is this person really an expert? Do other experts agree with this expert?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Argument from Consequence:</strong>
                    Are there possible consequences other than the ones you're using as evidence? How likely is it that these consequences will occur?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Argument from Observation:</strong>
                    Are there other ways to interpret the observation? How certain is the observation?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Argument from Comparison:</strong>
                    Are the two things you're comparing really that similar?
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How will being able to ask critical questions help my students?</h3>
            <p>Students who can ask appropriate critical questions about an argument are more likely to</p>
            <ul>
                <li>identify weak evidence;</li>
                <li>find holes in others' arguments;</li>
                <li>anticipate using <em>Backing</em> to help evidence hold up against critical questions;</li>
                <li>evaluate the strength of their own arguments, and strengthen them if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How do players ask critical questions in the game?</h3>
            <p>
                Players use critical questions against opponents in battles. To have access to the critical questions, a player must 'level up" an argubot by seeing Lucas several times and going through challenges that involve matching evidence to the appropriate argument scheme. When players level up an argubot, they unlock the critical questions corresponding to the argubot's argument scheme.
                <strong>The only way to have access to all critical questions is for the player to level up all four argubots.</strong>
                For that reason, you should remind your students to level up all of their argubots if they can.
            </p>
            <h3>What does asking critical questions look like in the game?</h3>
            <p>Before beginning a battle, players select the critical questions they want to use against an opponent. The player has to look at which argubots the opponent is using (i.e., which schemes they are using) so that he or she can ask the appropriate critical questions to attack the argument and look for weaknesses. In the image below, the opponent (on the right) is using a comparadroid to make an 'argument from comparison," and either of the critical questions on the left are appropriate.</p>
            <div><img src="http://placekitten.com/341/256" alt="need a real image"></div>
            <h3>What does asking critical questions look like in the real world?</h3>
            <p><strong>Here's an example you can use with the class.</strong></p>
            <p>Evelyn listens to Roy make an argument from observation about the type of rock that he's holding. Roy says, 'This rock is a metamorphic rock. I observed that it's brittle and that it's also hard to scratch. Those are two characteristics of metamorphic rocks, and so I claim that it's a metamorphic rock."</p>
            <p>Evelyn takes the rock from Roy, looks at it for a minute, and then asks him the following critical question: "<em>How sure are you about this observation</em>?" Then she says (without really waiting for an answer), 'First of all, the rock is black. That means that it could be basalt. And basalt is an igneous rock. Also, I can see that the rock has layers. Metamorphic rocks definitely don't have layers. And one more thing—it can't be a sedimentary rock because those are soft and scratch easily. This one is hard and doesn't scratch. This is an igneous rock."</p>
            <p>By asking that question, Evelyn found a weakness in Roy's argument. Although his observation wasn't wrong, it was incomplete and therefore weakened his argument.</p>
            <h3>What's the relationship between asking critical questions and using backing?</h3>
            <p>Students should get in the habit of asking critical questions about their own arguments. If the answers to critical questions are negative, an argument is weakened because the evidence is not well-supported. In the example above, the answer to Evelyn's critical question, 'How sure are you about this observation?" ,was 'Not very," because Roy's observation was incomplete. Therefore, the argument was weakened. If the answers to critical questions are positive, however, then an argument is strengthened because the evidence is backed up.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Using backing,</strong>
                another skill that students practice in the game, is closely tied to asking critical questions. Backing is additional information that strengthens evidence and is a way to respond to critical questions positively, so long as the backing is accurate. Using backing strengthens arguments.
            </p>

                            The second half of the Drill Down report shows you each attempt that a student made to ask critical questions of an opponent's argument. Each row in the table represents one attempt during a battle in that mission. For each attempt, the table shows the opponent's argubot (i.e., the argument scheme), the evidence about which the student asked a critical question, the text of the critical question, and whether the critical question matched the evidence's argument scheme.

                        <li>
                            <strong>They're unable to evaluate the quality of evidence.</strong>
                            If students don't understand that evidence can be evaluated for purposes other than being 'right or wrong" or 'relevant or irrelevant," then they may not understand the purpose of asking critical questions. By understanding that evidence can be evaluated (as strong or weak, for example), students are in a better position to recognize that asking critical questions is a way to determine how well the evidence supports the claim.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>They have trouble distinguishing among argument schemes.</strong>
                            If students are unable to tell the difference among the four argument schemes (perhaps because of the keywords for each), then it is unlikely that they will be able to use critical questions that relate to specific schemes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Students may not have access to the correct critical questions</strong>
                            <em>(in the game only).</em> Students have to level up their argubots to get access to the corresponding critical questions. Students don't always remember to level up their bots, however, and so they won't have access to the critical questions for those bots during a battle. They will have access to critical questions for any bot they have leveled up. NOTE: The yellow flag in the Drill Down report shows you whether students have leveled up their argubots and have access to critical questions.

                    <ul>
                        <li>If a majority of a student's incorrect attempts seem to be from one argubot, then a student may be struggling with the language of the evidence for that argument scheme, or with the language of the critical questions for that argument scheme.</li>
                        <li>If a student has multiple incorrect attempts with more than one argubot, then a student may be struggling at a conceptual level with the differences between the argument schemes. Or, a student also may be struggling with the language for more than one argument scheme.</li>
