        <h1>STEP 1: Where Are We Going?</h1>
        <div><strong>Familiarize yourself with how this skill fits into the practice of engaging in argument from evidence, and what it looks like when learners use it in the game and in real life.</strong> It's helpful to know what the learning target looks like in practice, before you review gameplay data, to get a sense of how far a student is from achieving the learning goal.</div>
        <div style="color:blue">In Brief</div>
        <div><strong>Critical questions help arguers evaluate the strength of an argument—either their own or an opponent’s.</strong> The questions are often specific to an argument scheme and help an arguer look for weaknesses and poke holes in arguments by seeing if the evidence is well-supported. By asking critical questions, an arguer can determine exactly how justified a claim really is.</div>

        <div style="color:blue">What does asking critical questions look like in the real world?</div>
        <div><strong>A student who asks appropriate critical questions understands the argument scheme behind an argument and is aware that the answers to critical questions will either strengthen or weaken the argument.</strong></div>
        <div>For example:</div>
        <div>Rhonda listens to her classmate Evelyn make the following argument from observation about a shell inside of a classroom terrarium. “This is the shell of a tortoise. I know that because I can see that the tank is filled mostly with water and some logs and plants.” Rhonda knows that there’s a difference between tortoises and turtles, however. She also realizes that Evelyn is making an argument using evidence based on her observation of the contents of the tank. So, she asks the following critical questions about Evelyn’s evidence (i.e., a shell inside a tank with mostly water): “Could this be the shell of another animal?” “Isn’t the water really more of a sign that this is a turtle shell, because tortoises don’t live in water?” The answers to those critical questions weaken Rhonda’s claim that it’s a tortoise shell.</div>
        <div style="color:blue">More About Critical Questions</div>
        <div>Students can ask critical questions about the evidence that an arguer uses. As another example, below are four critical questions that a student might ask about the evidence used in an argument from authority.</div>
        <ol>
            <li>Is the expert whose statement you’re using as evidence really in a position to know whether your claim is true?</li>
            <li>Is the expert a trustworthy source?</li>
            <li>Did the expert assert that your claim is true?</li>
            <li>Do other experts agree with your expert?</li>
        </ol>
        <div>If any of the answers to questions 1–4 is “No,” then an argument is weakened because the evidence is not well-supported. If any of the answers is “Yes,” however, then an argument is strengthened because the evidence is backed up.</div>
        <div><strong>Using backing</strong>-—another skill that students practice in the game—is closely tied to the activity of asking critical questions. Backing is additional information that strengthens evidence and is a way to respond to critical questions. For example, in response to question #1 above, if a student provides information to show that an expert is world-renowned in a topic, then that student has strengthened her argument.</div>
        <div style="color:blue">What does asking critical questions look like in the game?</div>
        <div><strong>What does it look like in the game?</strong></div>
        <div>Players use critical questions in duels. To begin using them, a player must “level up” an argubot by seeing Lucas several times and going through several challenges that involve matching evidence to the appropriate argument scheme. The only way to have access to all critical questions is for the player to level up all four argubots and unlock the corresponding critical questions.</div>
        <div>Before beginning a duel, the player selects the critical questions he or she wants to use against an opponent. The player should be aware of the opponent’s robot types, as he or she will have to be prepared with the appropriate critical questions if they are to attack the argument and look for weaknesses.</div>

        <h1>STEP 2: Where Are We Now?</h1>
        <div><strong>With the learning target for this skill in mind, see how effectively students are using it in the game.</strong></div>
        <div style="color:blue">What Data are Available About This Skill?</div>
        <div><strong>PERFORMANCE OVER TIME REPORT</strong></div>
        <div><strong>What it shows: This report</strong> shows how well students applied this skill on all completed missions in which they had to use it. It also shows how long or how consistently students have been struggling or succeeding with the skill.</div>
        <div><strong>How you can use it:</strong> The report can help you determine the level of additional support to provide for a student or students. A mix of yellow and green circles could indicate a need to talk with your students to determine why they're struggling.</div>
        <div><strong>What the icons mean:</strong></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Green circle (Advancing) = the student completed the mission with a 70% or higher success rate</li>
            <li>Yellow circle (Needs Support) = the student completed the mission with a 69% or lower success rate</li>
            <li>Gray circle (Not Enough Data) = there's not yet enough gameplay data from that mission to report</li>
            <li>Empty circle (Level Not Yet Attempted)</li>
        </ul>
        <div><strong>PERFORMANCE DRILL DOWN REPORT</strong></div>
        <div><strong>This report shows a student’s success rate at asking critical questions that are appropriate to argument schemes. </strong>The success rate displays as a ratio: total number of correct attempts over total number of attempts. The report does not break out success rates by argument scheme. For that reason, you might need to do some follow-up with your students to determine whether they’re struggling with thinking about which questions are appropriate to specific argument schemes. There are materials in Step 3 to help with this.</div>

        <h1>STEP 3: How Do We Get From Here To Where We Need To Go?</h1>
        <div><strong>After reviewing the student data, make a plan to help students move toward the learning target for this skill.</strong></div>
        <div style="color:blue">Why Might Students Struggle With This Skill?</div>
        <ol>
            <li>They might not understand that critical questions are meant to evaluate evidence, because they do not understand that the quality of evidence is what weakens or strengthens an argument.</li>
            <li>They might not understand that critical questions are specific to each argument scheme.</li>
            <li>Students must level-up an argubot type before having access to the corresponding critical questions. Students do not always level-up their bots, however, and in that case they simply won’t have access to the critical questions during a duel.</li>
        </ol>
