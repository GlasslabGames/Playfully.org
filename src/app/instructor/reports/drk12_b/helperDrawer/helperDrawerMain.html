        <p>Report Helper is a tool to help you review student gameplay, determine progress toward targeted learning skills, and plan next instructional steps based on that progress.</p>

        <div ng-show="isClassViewActive">
            <p>The four pie charts on the Progress Report Summary page display progress for the whole class <strong>on their most recent mission</strong> for each skill. Students in green are Advancing; students in yellow Need Support; and students in gray do not yet have enough data to make an assessment.</p>
            <p><strong>Click on the “Student Roster” tab above to begin reviewing gameplay data for students.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div ng-show="isClassViewActive === false">
        To begin reviewing gameplay data:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>First select the skill you want to review.</strong> You can either review <strong>one skill at a time</strong> or <strong>all four at once.</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If you review <strong>one skill</strong>, next choose the level of progress by which you want to sort students.</li>
                        <li>If you review <strong>All Skills</strong>, instead of one, then you won’t have the option to sort by progress level.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lastly, <strong>choose which students you want to review (or Select All).</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            You can also <strong>click on any of the colored circles</strong> to drill down and see the gameplay data for that student on a specific skill in that mission.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <hr/>
        <p>For each skill report, the Helper guides you through three steps, which are always visible on the left-hand side:</p>
        <p class="padding-left-20"><strong>Step 1: Where Are We Going?</strong> familiarizes you with what the skill you’re reviewing looks like in practice</p>
        <p class="padding-left-20"><strong>Step 2: Where Are We Now?</strong> helps you to determine student progress on a skill throughout gameplay, and to make preliminary judgments about whether and why students might be struggling</p>
        <p class="padding-left-20"><strong>Step 3: How Do We Get From Here to Where We Need to Go?</strong> helps you plan for any instructional changes to help your students achieve the learning skills</p>
        <p>Links to additional resources, if available, will always be available at the top of the Step 1 window. The information for this step will change as you select inpidual skills to review.</p>
        <p><strong>Please note: the gameplay data for each report refreshes once every 30 minutes.</strong></p>
