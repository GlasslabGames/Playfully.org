            <h3>What are the learning goals for "supporting claims with evidence"?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Students are able to explain that arguments consist of claims supported by evidence</li>
                <li>Students are able to identify evidence that does not support a claim because it is either irrelevant or contradictory to the claim</li>
                <li>Students are able to construct a claim that uses evidence that is relevant and that supports a claim</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What does it mean to use evidence to support a claim?</h3>
            <p>
                For any argument to be valid, the evidence that's used to support it must be appropriate. That means that a piece of evidence should be
                <strong>relevant</strong>
                to the claim (i.e., it's on the same topic) and it
                <strong>shouldn't contradict the claim</strong>
                (i.e., it shouldn't undermine the claim). While they might have an opinion, students don't have a valid argument if they don't meet these criteria for supportive evidence
            </p>
            <div><img src="/assets/ReportHelper_Image4.png" height="256px" width="341px"></div>
            <h3>How will supporting claims with evidence help my students?</h3>
            <p>Kids who can use evidence appropriately to support a claim are more likely to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make stronger arguments because the evidence supports the claim</li>
                <li>Consider whether and how a piece of evidence supports the claim</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How do players support claims with evidence in the game?</h3>
            <p>A claim core (i.e., a claim "fused" with evidence) is the way that students bring working argubots (i.e., argument schemes) into duels. To enter a duel, players must equip each of their argubots with a claim core. To win a duel, players need to identify weaknesses in their opponent's claim cores.</p>
            <h3>What does using backing look like in the game?</h3>
            <p>Students practice this skill in two different ways during gameplay:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Core building before a duel:</strong>
                    Before entering a duel, players gather evidence and then fuse it with one of three claims (which already exist) to create a claim core.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            <strong>a. Successful attempts:</strong>
                            Recorded each time a player fuses a claim with supporting evidence.
                            <div><img src="/assets/ReportHelper_Image5.png" height="256px" width="341px"></div>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Attacking opponents' cores during a duel:</strong>
                    During each duel, players must attack their opponent's arguments by identifying whether the evidence is either irrelevant to or contradicts the claim.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Successful attempts:</strong>
                            Each attack round where a player successfully identifies an opponent's evidence as either irrelevant or contradictory.
                            <div><img src="/assets/ReportHelper_Image6.png" height="256px" width="341px"></div>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>What does irrelevant or contradictory evidence look like in the game?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Understanding what makes evidence irrelevant or contradictory can be very tricky.</strong>
                As a rule of thumb: evidence that isn't related to a claim (e.g., it's off-topic) is irrelevant and evidence that undermines a claim contradicts is.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>For example:</strong>
                If a student decides to build a core to support a claim that states, "<em>Temple Run</em> is the best video game of all time," then:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Evidence that says "A big improvement in your reaction time is a consequence of playing <em>Temple Run</em>"
                    <strong>supports the claim.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Evidence that says "One game authority, Dr. S. Hoyle, says <em>Temple Run</em> puts people to sleep"
                    <strong>contradicts the claim.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Evidence that says "One consequence of brushing your teeth is that you get fewer cavities" is
                    <strong>not relevant to the claim.</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What does successfully supporting a claim with evidence look like in the real world?</h3>
            <p><strong>Here's an example you can use with the class:</strong></p>
            <p>Lauren listens to Eric make an argument from authority. His claim is that "It's wrong to plant genetically modified seeds." He then uses two pieces of evidence to support his claim: "Experts say that people in Europe don't eat many fruits and vegetables that come from genetically modified seeds. And, a consequence of eating food from genetically modified seeds is that people will be healthier."</p>
            <p>After listening to the argument, Lauren says that this is a weak argument. Erik has used irrelevant and contradictory evidence. While the topic of the claim is about "planting genetically modified food," the first piece of evidence is about "eating food from genetically modified seeds"—the evidence is irrelevant because it's on a different topic. For it to be relevant, the evidence needs to be about the same topic as the claim.</p>
            <p>The second piece of evidence that Erik used contradicts the claim: “a consequence of eating food from genetically modified seeds is that people will be healthier" means that planting genetically modified seeds is a good thing. That's not what Erik is claiming!</p>

                            A snapshot of how students are doing with supporting claims with evidence on the most recent mission they've played. Don't make too much of it—like many games, students have multiple opportunities to use skills across missions.
                            <strong>The pie charts only display data about how students did on the most recent mission.</strong>

                                <li>You might start seeing groups of students here—for example, students who seem to be consistently advancing or struggling across multiple missions.</li>

                                    <strong>Break it up:</strong>
                                    Use the “Filter data by" menu (right under the Performance Over Time title) to see how students are doing with supporting claims with evidence in two ways: First, with using evidence that is relevant and does not contradict the claim when creating their own claim cores (i.e., constructing their own argument by linking a claim to evidence). Second, you can see how students are doing with correctly pointing out irrelevant or contradictory evidence that their opponents are using in duels.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>While it's unlikely, it's possible that students might be successful in one case while being unsuccessful in the other because they are guessing. If a student knows how to determine whether evidence is irrelevant or contradictory, she or he should be able to do it in both cases.</li>

                            The second half of the Drill Down report shows you each attempt that a student made to create an argument by supporting a claim with evidence (the table on the left) or to identify evidence that is irrelevant or contradictory in their opponents' arguments during duels (the table on the right)
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    For “Built": Each row in the table represents one attempt to fuse a claim core. For each attempt, the table shows the player's claim, the evidence the student chose to support the claim, and whether the evidence is relevant <em>and</em> non-contradictory.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Because the language that distinguishes irrelevant from contradictory can be tricky, the data does not distinguish between incorrect attempts for either.</li>

                                    For “Opponent Claim Cores Attached": Each row in the table represents one attempt to attack an opponent's argument during a duel. Each row in the table represents an opponent's claim core (i.e., the claim and the evidence), the student's determination as to whether the evidence is irrelevant or contradictory, and whether that determination was correct.

                        <li>
                            <strong>The language is tricky.</strong>
                            The language of the evidence that students collect can sometimes be subtle, which makes it difficult to distinguish between evidence that is contradictory and evidence that is irrelevant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>It's hard to keep the topic in mind.</strong>
                            Students might have a hard time keeping the topic of the claim and the topic of the evidence topic in mind at the same time, which then makes it difficult to judge whether the evidence is relevant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>They don't understand the claim.</strong>
                            If students do not fully understand what a claim is about, then they might find it difficult to determine whether a piece of evidence supports it (i.e., is non-contradictory) or undermines it (i.e., contradicts it).
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If the evidence is clearly contradictory or irrelevant to the claim, then students might be having trouble keeping the claim in mind as they attach evidence</li>
                        <li>If the claim cores students are creating and critiquing are more nuanced, then students may be struggling with language. It can be hard to distinguish what is evidence that is relevant and non-contradictory at times</li>

By reviewing several gameplay attempts with them, and asking them to explain their choices, you'll get more insight into whether students are struggling with using evidence to support a claim because they are struggling with the language of the claims and evidence, they are having a hard time keeping the topic of the argument in mind, or because they do not understand the claims they are using.
