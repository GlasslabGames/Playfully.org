            <h3>What are the learning goals for "supporting claims with evidence"?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Students are able to explain that arguments consist of claims supported by evidence</li>
                <li>Students are able to identify evidence that does not support a claim because it is either irrelevant or contradictory to the claim</li>
                <li>Students are able to construct a claim that uses evidence that is relevant and that supports a claim</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What does it mean to use evidence to support a claim?</h3>
            <p>
                For any argument to be valid, the claim must be accompanied by evidence that is both
                <strong>relevant</strong>
                and supportive. While students may have an opinion about a topic, they won't have a valid argument if it doesn't meet these criteria.
            </p>
            <div><img src="/assets/ReportHelper_Image4.png" height="256px" width="341px"></div>
            <h3>How will supporting claims with evidence help my students?</h3>
            <p>Students who can use evidence appropriately to support a claim are more likely to</p>
            <ul>
                <li>make stronger arguments because the evidence supports the claim, and</li>
                <li>consider whether and how a piece of evidence supports the claim so they can critique the others' arguments.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How do players support claims with evidence in the game?</h3>
            <p>Students battle their opponents by equipping their own argubots with claim cores—a claim matched, or "fused," with evidence. To win a battle, players must have equipped their argubot with a strong claim core, and they have to identify weaknesses in their opponent's claim cores.</p>
            <h3>What does supporting claims and evidence look like in the game?</h3>
            <p>Students practice this skill in two different ways during gameplay.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Core building before a battle.</strong>
                    In the game, students are given three possible claims, and they gather evidence for those claims. Before entering a battle, they choose one of the claims and a corresponding piece of evidence, and fuse the two to create their claim core.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Successful attempts:</strong>
                            Recorded each time a player fuses a claim with evidence that is both supportive and relevant.
                            <div><img src="/assets/ReportHelper_Image5.png" height="256px" width="341px"></div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Attacking opponents' cores during a battle.</strong>
                    During each battle, players must attack their opponent's arguments by identifying whether the evidence is either irrelevant to the claim, or contradictory to it.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Successful attempts:</strong>
                            Each attack round where a player successfully identifies an opponent's evidence as either irrelevant or contradictory.
                            <div><img src="/assets/ReportHelper_Image6.png" height="256px" width="341px"></div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>What does irrelevant or contradictory evidence look like in the game?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Understanding what makes evidence irrelevant or contradictory can be very tricky.</strong>
                As a rule of thumb, evidence that isn't related to the topic of a claim is irrelevant, and evidence that undermines a claim is contradictory.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>For example:</strong>
                If a student decides to build a core to support a claim that states, "<em>Temple Run</em> is the best video game of all time," then
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    evidence that says "A big improvement in your reaction time is a consequence of playing <em>Temple Run</em>"
                    <strong>supports the claim;</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    evidence that says "One game authority, Dr. S. Hoyle, says <em>Temple Run</em> puts people to sleep"
                    <strong>contradicts the claim;</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    evidence that says "One consequence of brushing your teeth is that you get fewer cavities" is
                    <strong>not relevant to the claim.</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What does successfully supporting a claim with evidence look like in the real world?</h3>
            <p><strong>Here's an example you can use with the class.</strong></p>
            <p>Lauren listens to Eric make an argument from authority. His claim is that "It's wrong to plant genetically modified seeds." He then uses two pieces of evidence to support his claim: (1) "Experts say that people in Europe don't eat many fruits and vegetables" and (2) "A consequence of eating food from genetically modified seeds is that people will be healthier."</p>
            <p>After listening to the argument, Lauren says that this is a weak argument. Erik has used irrelevant and contradictory evidence. While the topic of the claim is about "planting genetically modified seeds," the first piece of evidence is about "eating fruits and vegetables"—the evidence is irrelevant because it's on a different topic. For it to be relevant, the evidence has to be about the same topic as the claim.</p>
            <p>The second piece of evidence that Erik used contradicts the claim: "A consequence of eating food from genetically modified seeds is that people will be healthier" means that planting genetically modified seeds is a good thing. That's not what Erik is claiming!</p>

                            Allows you to see student success for supporting claims with evidence in two ways: first, how well students are  constructing their own arguments by using evidence that is relevant and supportive of their claim, and second, how well students are attacking their opponent's claims in battles by pointing out whether opponents are using irrelevant or contradictory evidence.
                            <ul>
                                <li>While it's unlikely, it's possible that students might be successful in one situation while being unsuccessful in the other because they are guessing.

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The language is tricky.</strong>
                            The language of the evidence that students collect can sometimes be subtle, which makes it difficult to distinguish between evidence that is contradictory and evidence that is irrelevant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>It's hard to keep the topic in mind.</strong>
                            Students may have a hard time keeping the topic of the claim and the topic of the evidence in mind at the same time, which then makes it difficult to judge whether the evidence is relevant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>They don't understand the claim.</strong>
                            If students do not fully understand what a claim is about, then they may find it difficult to determine whether a piece of evidence supports it or undermines it.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If the evidence is clearly contradictory or irrelevant to the claim, then students may be having trouble keeping the claim in mind as they attach evidence.</li>
                        <li>If the claim cores that students are creating and critiquing are more nuanced, then students may be struggling with language.</li>

                            to create groups and assign different materials or activities depending on a student's needs (for students who are struggling or advancing).

                            for conferencing with students. By reviewing several gameplay attempts with them, and asking them to explain their choices, you'll get more insight into whether students are struggling with using evidence to support a claim because they are struggling with the language of the claims and evidence, whether they are having a hard time keeping the topic of the argument in mind, or whether they do not understand the claims they are using.
