        <h1>STEP 1: Where Are We Going?</h1>
        <strong>Familiarize yourself with how this skill fits into the practice of engaging in argument from evidence, and what it looks like when learners use it in the game and in real life.</strong> It's helpful to know what the learning target looks like in practice, before you review gameplay data, to get a sense of how far a student is from achieving the learning goal.
        <div style="color:blue">In Brief</div>
        <strong>The evidence used to support a claim in an argument should be relevant to the claim and should not contradict it.</strong> In general, evidence is relevant (or “related”) when it’s on the same topic as the claim. Evidence is “non-contradictory” when it agrees with the claim. If the evidence somehow undermines the claim, then it’s contradictory.

        <div style="color:blue">What does supporting claims with evidence look like in the real world?</div>
        <strong>A student who uses relevant and non-contradictory evidence to support a claim understands that evidence must be on the same topic as a claim, and that it must not contradict the claim.</strong>
        <div>For example:</div>
        <div>Lauren listens to her classmate Eric make the following argument. “It’s wrong to plant genetically modified seeds. Experts say that people in Europe tend to eat very little genetically modified fruits and vegetables. Also, a consequence of eating food from genetically modified seeds is that people will be healthier.” Lauren points out this that this is a weak argument because the evidence that Eric used is both irrelevant and contradictory to the claim. While the claim is about “planting genetically modified food,” the first piece of evidence is about “eating food from genetically modified seeds.” The second piece of evidence contradicts the claim because it indirectly suggests that planting genetically modified seeds is a good thing.</div>
        <div style="color:blue">More About Supporting Claims With Evidence</div>
        <div>Identifying evidence that is relevant and that doesn’t contradict a claim is hard work. To do so, a student must stop and consider the topic of her claim. Then, keeping that in mind, she has to ask the following questions:</div>
        <ol>
            <li>What word or words show that the evidence is about the same topic (or is not about the same topic)?</li>
            <li>Does this evidence relate to the same topic as my claim?</li>
            <li>What word or words show that the evidence weakens (or strengthens) my claim?</li>
            <li>Does this piece of evidence weaken or go against my claim in any way?</li>
        </ol>
        <div>Students who are adept at this will be able to build and defend their own arguments, and to critically analyze the arguments of others by:</div>
        <ol>
            <li>identifying evidence as relevant or irrelevant to a claim, and explaining their rationale; and</li>
            <li>identifying evidence that directly supports or contradicts a claim, and explaining their rationale.</li>
        </ol>
        <div style="color:blue">What does supporting claims with evidence look like in the game?</div>
        <div>Once players feel confident that they have identified evidence that is relevant to, and supports, their chosen claim, they fuse these two elements together in order to equip an argubot. In a duel, opponents will evaluate the legitimacy of these claim-evidence pairs.</div>
        <div><strong>For example,</strong> if a student chooses to build a core to support the claim “Temple Run is the best videogame of all time,” then</div>
        <ul>
            <li>"A big improvement in your reaction time is a consequence of playing Temple Run" <strong>supports the claim</strong></li>
            <li>"One game authority, Dr. S. Hoyle, says Temple Run puts people to sleep" <strong>contradicts the claim</strong></li>
            <li>"One consequence of brushing your teeth is that you get fewer cavities" <strong>is not relevant to the claim</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <div>Each time an opponent presents a claim-evidence pair during battle, the player can call out (or “attack”) any evidence that contradicts or is not relevant to their opponent’s claim.</div>
        <div><strong>For example,</strong> if an opponent chooses to support the claim "SimCity is the best video game of all time," then</div>
        <ul>
            <li>“Game expert Christy Marx thinks Temple Run is the most exciting game there is” should be attacked because it <strong>contradicts the claim</strong></li>
            <li>“A consequence of playing chess is long awkward silences” should be attacked because it <strong>is not relevant to the claim</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <div>Claim-evidence pairs in the game take the form of argubot cores. Students work on this skill in two different ways:</div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>They build argubot cores with claim-evidence pairs to take into battle.</strong>
                <ol>

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>They launch attacks against opponents’ argubot cores.</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>###Insert Image 6 and text here###</li>

        <div><strong>With the learning target for this skill in mind, see how effectively students are using it in the game.</strong></div>
        <div style="color:blue">What Data are Available About This Skill?</div>
        <div><strong>PERFORMANCE OVER TIME REPORT</strong></div>
        <div><strong>What it shows:</strong> shows how well students applied this skill on all completed missions in which they had to use it. It also shows how long or how consistently students have been struggling or succeeding with the skill.</div>
        <div><strong>How you can use it:</strong> The report can help you determine the level of additional support to provide for a student or students. A mix of yellow and green circles could indicate a need to talk with your students to determine why they're struggling.</div>
        <div><strong>What the icons mean:</strong></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Green circle (Advancing) = the student completed the mission with a 70% or higher success rate</li>
            <li>Yellow circle (Needs Support) = the student completed the mission with a 69% or lower success rate</li>
            <li>Gray circle (Not Enough Data) = there's not yet enough gameplay data from that mission to report</li>
            <li>Empty circle (Level Not Yet Attempted)</li>
        </ul>
        <div><strong>PERFORMANCE DRILL DOWN REPORT</strong></div>
        <div><strong>What it shows: This report</strong> This report shows a student’s success rate at using evidence that is relevant and non-contradictory to a claim. The success rate displays as a ratio: total number of correct attempts/total number of attempts. <strong>The first ratio is a student’s success rate with identifying evidence that is either irrelevant or contradictory when dueling another character</strong> (i.e., in someone else’s argument). <strong>The second ratio is a student’s success rate with fusing claim cores</strong> (i.e., constructing an argument), using relevant and non-contradictory evidence.</div>
        <div><strong>How you can use it: The ratio doesn’t distinguish between “correct attempts with relevant evidence” and “correct attempts with non-contradictory evidence.”</strong> The reason for this is that the language differences in the evidence can be subtle. For that reason, you might have to do some follow-up with your students to determine whether they’re struggling with relevance, contradictory evidence, or both. There are materials in Step 3 to help with this.</div>

        <ol>
            <li>The language of the evidence that students collect can be subtle, making it difficult to distinguish between evidence that is contradictory and evidence that is irrelevant.</li>
            <li>They might have difficulty keeping the claim topic and the evidence topic in mind at the same time, which makes it difficult to judge whether the evidence is relevant.</li>
            <li>If they do not fully understand a claim, they might find it difficult to determine whether a piece of evidence supports it (i.e., is non-contradictory) or undermines it (i.e., contradicts it).</li>
