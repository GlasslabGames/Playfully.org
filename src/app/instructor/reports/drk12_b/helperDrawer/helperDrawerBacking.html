            <h3>What are the learning goals for "using backing"?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Students are able to use backing that is relevant to evidence and that strengthens the claim in an argument</li>
                <li>Students are able to explain how appropriate backing strengthens evidence and therefore strengthens an argument</li>
                <li>Students are able to explain how backing provides responses to critical questions</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What is using backing about?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Backing is "information that supports evidence."</strong>
                By ensuring that a piece of evidence is well-backed, an arguer has additional information that explains how a piece of evidence supports the claim. For example, if someone makes an argument from authority, they may use backing to provide extra information that explains how we know the person cited is an authority on the subject.
            </p>
            <p>Using backing is related to asking critical questions: Good backing "defends against" critical questions by ensuring that the evidence used to support a claim is strong. Students can use critical questions as a self-assessment by asking themselves a critical question to decide whether there is strong backing to support their argument, or they can pose critical questions to an opponent. If that opponent can't use backing to make a stronger connection between their evidence and the claim they're supporting, then it's likely the opponent's argument is not strong.</p>
            <h3>How will using backing help my students?</h3>
            <p>Students who can use backing appropriately to strengthen a piece of evidence are more likely to</p>
            <ul>
                <li>defend their arguments against critical questions;</li>
                <li>anticipate critical questions that others may ask about their own arguments;</li>
                <li>try to strengthen evidence to support a claim.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How do players use backing in the game?</h3>
            <p>Using backing is considered an advanced skill, and students don't use it until later in gameplay. In later missions, players can begin loading pieces of evidence into the "Backing Machine." If students take a claim core for which they've discovered the backing into battle, then they can defend against critical questions launched by their opponents. Students must make sure the backing for their evidence is good, though. While most evidence has backing, not all of the backing is supportive or relevant to the evidence.</p>
            <h3>What does using backing look like in the game?</h3>
            <p>When a player uses evidence that has backing that supports the evidence, then his or her bot will be "shielded" from critical questions from opponents during battles.</p>
            <img src="http://placekitten.com/600/500" alt="need a real image">
            <p>
                <strong>Backing the evidence up.</strong>
                Students use the "Backing Machine" to add backing to a piece of evidence. While most evidence that students put in the machine will have backing, not all backing will be good backing. Good backing must support the evidence, which enables students to defend against critical questions. Players have to read backing text carefully to make sure it's good backing! Once they've confirmed that it's good backing, they can use the evidence to fuse their claim core and take it into a battle.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Defending against critical questions.</strong>
                Backing allows students to defend against critical question attacks. Using evidence with several pieces of valid backing allows students to defend against critical question attacks, because the argument is made stronger by well-backed evidence.
            </p>

            <h3>What does using backing look like in the real world?</h3>
            <p><strong>Here's an example you can use with the class.</strong></p>
            <p>Martin makes the following argument from authority: "The dinosaurs were wiped out 66 million years ago when a giant asteroid smashed into Earth. Dr. Nabila Shaheen recently published an article in a scientific journal that made that claim."</p>
            <p>Martin knows that there are other theories about why the dinosaurs went extinct, and he's sure that his classmates are going to ask critical questions about the evidence that he used to support his claim. So, he adds two pieces of backing (that is, additional information) about his evidence to support his argument.</p>
            <p>He says, "Dr. Shaheen is a highly-respected paleontologist. She has studied the question of how dinosaurs went extinct for over 20 years." And then he adds, "Also, other researchers have published articles making the same claim and using evidence to support the idea that it was an asteroid, and not volcanic activity over a long period of time."</p>
            <p>By including that additional information, Martin was able to defend against at least two critical questions: "Is this person really an authority on the topic?" "Do other experts agree with this expert?" Using this backing strengthened his argument.</p>

                    <h3>Why might students struggle with this skill?</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>They don't expect critical questions from others.</strong>
                            If students don't expect that others will ask critical questions about their evidence (or understand that evidence can be evaluated beyond being "right" or "wrong"), then they may not understand the need to use backing as a way to make evidence stronger.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>They don't ask critical questions about their own arguments.</strong>
                            If students don't ask critical questions about their own evidence, they may not stop to think about what kind of information would strengthen their argument (or even that they should make a different argument because their evidence is weak).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>They have trouble distinguishing among argument schemes (and the critical questions that go with them).</strong>
                            If students are unable to tell the difference among the four argument schemes (perhaps based on the keywords for each of them) and the critical questions associated with them, then it is unlikely that they will be able to use backing that responds to specific critical questions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>They struggle with the language of the backing.</strong>
                            Students may be unable to determine whether a piece of backing strengthens the evidence if they struggle with deciphering the words in the backing.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>How to make inferences about student progress using the data</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a majority of a student's incorrect attempts seem to be from one argubot (for both "Backing Chosen" and "Backing Used"), then a student may be struggling with the language of the evidence for that argument scheme, or with the language of the backing for the evidence.</li>
                        <li>If a student has multiple incorrect attempts with more than one argubot (for both "Backing Chosen" and "Backing Used"), then a student may be struggling at a conceptual level with the differences between the argument schemes. Or, a student may also be struggling with the language for more than one argument scheme.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                            for conferencing with students. By reviewing several gameplay attempts with them, and asking them to explain their choices, you'll get more insight into whether students are struggling with using backing questions because of language, concepts, or both.
