            <strong>Familiarize yourself with how this skill fits into the practice of engaging in argument from evidence, and what it looks like when learners use it in the game and in real life.</strong> It's helpful to know what the learning target looks like in practice, before you review gameplay data, to get a sense of how far a student is from achieving the learning goal.
            <div style="color:blue" ng-attr-id="{{ids[1]}}">In Brief</div>
            Argument schemes are the underlying premises for common types of arguments, such as an “argument from authority.” When these premises are true, arguments are stronger because the logical connections among claim, evidence, and reasoning are clear and justified. Being able to identify argument schemes is valuable because all argument schemes have their own set of critical questions that help an arguer to evaluate the strength of an argument.

            <div style="color:blue" ng-attr-id="{{ids[3]}}">What does connecting evidence to argument schemes look like in the real world?</div>
            <strong>A student who is familiar with argument schemes is able to look at the evidence that someone uses to support a claim and determine what argument scheme that person is using.</strong>
            For example:
            Eric listens to his classmate Lauren make the following argument. “Global climate change will lead to lots of extinctions. Professor Deandra Sager says that Earth will lose one-sixth of all its species if climate change keeps going at this rate.” Eric knows that this as an “argument from authority” because Lauren used a piece of evidence based on what someone who seems to be an expert said. Knowing that, he can ask critical questions related to arguments from authority to determine how strong the evidence is, and therefore how strong the argument is. For example, he might ask, “Is Professor Sager actually an expert in this area?” Or, “Do other experts agree with her?”
            <div style="color:blue" ng-attr-id="{{ids[4]}}">More About Argument Schemes</div>
            <strong>The type of evidence used to support a claim determines what type of argument scheme someone is using.</strong> There are many types of argument schemes, but in the game players use four:
            <ol>
                <li>Using evidence from an expert to support a claim leads to <strong>argument from authority</strong></li>
                <li>Using evidence based on possible positive or negative outcomes to support a claim leads to an <strong>argument from consequences</strong></li>
                <li>Using evidence from observation or experiment to support a claim leads to an <strong>argument from observation</strong></li>
                <li>Using evidence that compares one thing to another to support a claim leads to <strong>argument from comparison</strong></li>
            </ol>
            Every argument scheme has its own unwritten rules for making inferences from data to arrive at a conclusion (i.e., a claim). For example, in any “argument from authority,” one premise (usually implied) is that an expert is in a position to know about something. So, if someone uses a piece of evidence that's based on an expert's statement, then it's understood that this piece of evidence supports the claim because an expert is in a position to know.
            <strong>Being able to identify argument schemes is useful because it helps when evaluating the strength of an argument. A strong argument is a persuasive argument.</strong> A student who can identify the argument scheme she is using (or that an opponent is using in a debate) can ask critical questions about how well the evidence supports the claim, which affects how persuasive it is. In the example above, the student asked whether the expert was the right kind of expert to be using as support for this claim. If the answer is yes, then the evidence is stronger, but if the answer is no, then the evidence is weaker. Asking critical questions is another skill that students practice in the game, and it is tied to argument schemes. When a student asks critical questions that are appropriate to an argument scheme, he or she can make an argument stronger, or can weaken that of an opponent.
            <div style="color:blue" ng-attr-id="{{ids[5]}}">What does connecting evidence to argument schemes look like in the game?</div>
            Each of the four argument schemes matches a type of argubot. Evidence that players use generally includes keywords or phrases that help to identify the argument scheme.
            To match evidence to an argument scheme, students must consistently select evidence that matches the argubot type that they plan to use in a duel. There are two ways to do that:
            <ol>
                <strong>Giving Lucas evidence that matches an argubot type to “unlock” or “level up” that bot</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>####insert Image 1 and text below this list item####</li>
                </ol>
                <strong>Pairing claims and evidence to build an argubot core</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>####insert Images 2 and 3 and text below this list item####</li>
                </ol>

            <div style="color:blue" ng-attr-id="{{ids[7]}}">What Data are Available About This Skill?</div>
            <strong>PERFORMANCE OVER TIME REPORT</strong>
            <strong>What it shows: This report</strong> shows how well students applied this skill on all completed missions in which they had to use it. It also shows how long or how consistently students have been struggling or succeeding with the skill.
            <strong>How you can use it:</strong> The report can help you determine the level of additional support to provide for a student or students. A mix of yellow and green circles could indicate a need to talk with your students to determine why they're struggling.
            <strong>What the icons mean:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Green circle (Advancing) = the student completed the mission with a 70% or higher success rate</li>
                <li>Yellow circle (Needs Support) = the student completed the mission with a 69% or lower success rate</li>
                <li>Gray circle (Not Enough Data) = there's not yet enough gameplay data from that mission to report</li>
                <li>Empty circle (Level Not Yet Attempted)</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>PERFORMANCE DRILL DOWN REPORT</strong>
            <strong>What it shows: This report</strong> shows a student's success rate at correctly matching types of evidence to each of the four argument schemes. The success rate is displayed as a ratio: total number of correct attempts/total number of attempts.
            <strong>How you can use it:</strong> The report can help you determine the level of additional support to provide for a student or students. Inconsistent success rates across the argument schemes might suggest that students understand some schemes (or at least understand keywords or phrases that match some schemes), but do not understand others.
