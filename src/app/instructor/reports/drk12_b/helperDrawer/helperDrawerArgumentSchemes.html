            <h3>What are the learning goals for "identifying argument schemes"?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Students are able to identify the four argument schemes by using keywords from evidence</li>
                <li>Students are able to explain what makes the four argument schemes different from one another by referencing specific types of evidence</li>
                <li>Given the name of an argument scheme, students are able to choose the type of evidence that matches it correctly</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What are argument schemes?</h3>
            <p>Argument schemes are categories for different types of common arguments. The type of scheme depends on the evidence that's used to support a claim. The game covers four argument schemes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Argument from Authority:</strong> Using evidence from an expert to support a claim</li>
                <li><strong>Argument from Consequence:</strong> Using evidence based on possible positive or negative outcomes to support a claim</li>
                <li><strong>Argument from Observation:</strong> Using evidence from observation or experiment to support a claim</li>
                <li><strong>Argument from Comparison:</strong> Using evidence that compares one thing to another</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How will being able to identify argument schemes help my students?</h3>
            <p>Students who can identify argument schemes are more likely to</p>
            <ul>
                <li>use appropriate evidence in support of a claim;</li>
                <li>correctly explain why a piece of evidence does or does or does not support a claim; and</li>
                <li>use backing and ask critical questions effectively to strengthen their arguments and to evaluate others' arguments.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How do players identify argument schemes in the game?</h3>
            <p>Each argument scheme is represented by a different type of argubot—<strong>Authoritron, Consebot, Observatron,</strong> or <strong>Compararadroid</strong>. Your students must identify and use evidence that correctly matches the argubot's scheme. Evidence includes keywords or phrases that can help students identify the appropriate argument scheme for the various pieces of evidence they encounter. (See the chart below for examples.)</p>
            <h3>What does identifying argument schemes look like in the game?</h3>
            <p>Students practice this skill in two different ways during gameplay.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Training to get new bots.</strong> To begin using any of the four argubots, Lucas asks players to search for pieces of evidence that match the argubot's argument scheme.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Successful attempts:</strong> Recorded each time a player hands Lucas evidence that matches the target argubot's scheme.
                            <div><img src="/assets/ReportHelper_Image1.png" height="256px" width="341px"></div>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fusing Cores.</strong> Whenever students fuse claim cores to enter a battle, their evidence must match the scheme of the argubot they're using.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Successful attempts.</strong> Recorded when players fuse a core using evidence that matches the argubot they're using.
                            <br/>
                            <strong>NOTE:</strong> While players can fuse a core with evidence that doesn't match their argubot's scheme (the core builder will light up red when they do), they won't be able to enter a battle until they revise their claim core so that the evidence is relevant and supporting.
                            <div><img src="/assets/ReportHelper_Image3.png" height="256px" width="341px"></div>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How does an argument change depending on the scheme being used?</h3>
            <p>Most claims could be supported using evidence from different argument schemes. The chart below shows how evidence from the four schemes could be used to support the claim that "Lucas should be recognized for his commitment."</p>
            <table border="1px solid">
                <tr>
                    <td><img ng-src="/assets/drk_AUTHORITRON.png" class="drk-skill-icon"></td>

                    <th>Arguemnt from Observation</th>
                    <th>Argument from Consequence</th>
                    <th>Argument from Comparison</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><em>Evidence:</em> Al Clive is an <strong>AUTHORITY</strong> on robots and says we should reward Lucas.</td>
                    <td><em>Evidence:</em> Other engineers <strong>OBSERVED</strong> Lucas in the workshop improving an argubot on his birthday.</td>
                    <td><em>Evidence:</em> One <strong>CONSEQUENCE</strong> of rewarding Lucas is that others will take better care of robots.</td>
                    <td><em>Evidence:</em> Lucas is <strong>JUST LIKE</strong> animal rights activists that were rewarded for saving animals on Earth.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>What does successfully supporting a claim with evidence look like in the real world?</h3>
            <p><strong>Here's an example you can use with the class.</strong></p>
            <p>Lauren makes this argument in class: "Global climate change will lead to lots of animal extinctions [<em>That's the claim</em>]. Professor Dee Sager says that Earth will lose one-sixth of all its species if climate change keeps going at the current rate [<em>That's the evidence</em>]."</p>
            <p>Eric knows that Lauren made an "argument from authority." Her claim—the thing she's trying to get people to believe—is that "Global climate change will lead to lots of animal extinctions." Her evidence—what she uses to support her claim so that people don't just think it's just her opinion—is that "Professor Dee Sager says that Earth will lose one-sixth of all its species if climate change keeps going at the current rate."</p>
            <p>That piece of evidence is based on what Professor Dee Sager, who seems to be an expert, said. So, Lauren is making an "argument from authority." Because he knows what kind of argument she's making, Eric can ask critical questions to see just how strong her evidence is. For example, he might ask, "Is Professor Sager actually an expert on global climate change?" Or, "Do other experts agree with her?"</p>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Difficulty identifying keywords.</strong>
                            Although students may understand the basic concept of an argument scheme, they may have difficulty recognizing keywords and phrases that identify the scheme.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Not connecting argubots to their appropriate schemes.</strong>
                            Students may not realize that argubots represent a specific scheme, or they may forget which scheme is associated with which bot.

                            While students may recognize the keywords or phrases associated with an argument scheme, they may not understand the differences between the types of argument schemes.

                    <ul>
                        <li>If a student consistently struggles with using evidence from the correct scheme for a given consebot (e.g., incorrectly using evidence from authority with a consebot), then you may want to check whether that student understands the keywords associated with consequence or authority evidence. You may also check whether they understand that each bot requires its own type of evidence.</li>
                        <li>If a student is struggling with using a variety of evidence types, then you may infer that he or she is struggling with the concept of argument schemes.</li>
