    <strong>Watch Out: Contradictory Mechanic</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    In their most recent six attempts to build claim-evidence pairs, the player
    has created three or more contradictory pairs.

    <strong>What Now:</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    In continued play by the student, support her/him in thinking aloud about
    choices as the game progresses. In the next evidence gathering, claim core
    construction, or Argubot battle, use the game context to help the student:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Talk through what contradictory evidence means</li>
    <li>Identify pieces of contradictory evidence in the current game level, or</li>
    <li>Use the contradictory evidence to equip a robot or fight a battle</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Use the gameplay context to tease out and change misconceptions about
    contradictory vs. valid evidence.
