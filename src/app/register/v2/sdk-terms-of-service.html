            <p>For Accounts that are registered and authorized for use by multiple users (as in the case with school
                accounts), GlassLab grants you and all of your authorized users a personal, limited, non-exclusive
                license to use Content and Entitlements to which you have access for your non-commercial,
                non-transferable, limited uses solely as set forth herein and as set forth in any additional
                documentation and/or agreements applicable to the GlassLab Services accessed by you and only for the
                number of users authorized in your Account. For all other Accounts, GlassLab grants you a personal,
                limited, non-exclusive license to use Content and Entitlements to which you have access for your
                personal, private, non-commercial, non-transferable, limited uses solely as set forth herein and as set
                forth in any additional agreements applicable to the GlassLab Services accessed by you. Content and
                Entitlements and all other intellectual property rights in or on GlassLab Services as well as the
                products and services offered through GlassLab Services, are owned by GlassLab or GlassLab's third party
                licensors and is protected by United States and International copyright, trade dress, patent, and
                trademark laws, international conventions, and other laws protecting intellectual property and related
                proprietary rights. You may not copy or download any Content and/or Entitlements from a GlassLab Service
                unless you are expressly authorized to do so. In addition, unless expressly authorized by GlassLab, you
                may not distribute, publicly perform or display, lease, sell, transmit, transfer, publish, edit, copy,
                create derivative works from, rent, sub-license, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise
                make unauthorized use of Content or Entitlements. Any commercial use is prohibited. You agree not to
                remove, obscure, or alter copyright, patent, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to
                Content. Your rights are subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service as well as any other
                agreements applicable to the GlassLab Services you are using. </p>

            <p>GlassLab reserves all right, title and interest in Content, Entitlements and all associated copyrights,
                trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein that are not expressly granted to you in
                these Terms of Service. Your permitted use of Content and Entitlements described above is limited by the
                intellectual property rights of GlassLab and does not include any rights to other patents or
                intellectual property. Making unauthorized copies or distribution of Content and/or Entitlements found
                on GlassLab Services may result in the termination of your Account(s), prohibition on use of GlassLab
                Services, and further legal action. Content and/or Entitlement owners may take criminal or civil action
                against you for unauthorized use of intellectual property. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless
                GlassLab from any unauthorized or illegal conduct by you, or through the use of your Account, on
                GlassLab Services.</p>
            <br/>

            <h4>5. GlassLab Services, Content and Entitlement Availability</h4>

            <p>Entitlements may only be held in Accounts where access to and use of Content and Entitlements is
                permitted. Entitlements may be purchased or acquired only from GlassLab or an authorized retailer.
                GlassLab reserves the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire Entitlements, and GlassLab reserves the
                right to limit or block any request to acquire Entitlements for any reason. </p>

            <p>We do not guarantee that any Content or Entitlement will be available at all times, or that we will
                continue to offer particular Content or Entitlements for any particular length of time. We reserve the
                right to change and update Content and Entitlements without notice to you. Once you have redeemed your
                Entitlements, that content is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for other Entitlements or for
                cash, or other goods or services. </p>
            <br/>

            <h4>6. Contributing UGC to GlassLab Services </h4>

            <p>GlassLab does not pre-screen all UGC and does not endorse or approve any UGC that you and other users may
                contribute to GlassLab Services. You are solely responsible for your UGC and may be held liable for UGC
                that you post.</p>

            <p>GlassLab respects the intellectual property rights of others. You must have the legal right to upload UGC
                to GlassLab Services. You may not upload or post any UGC on GlassLab Services that infringes the
                copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights of a third party nor may you upload UGC that
                violates the law, this Terms of Service and/or any third party's right of privacy or right of publicity.
                You may upload only UGC that you are permitted to upload by the owner or by law. GlassLab may, without
                prior notice to you and in its sole judgment, remove UGC that may infringe the intellectual property or
                other rights of a third party. If you infringe GlassLab's or a third party's intellectual property or
                other rights, GlassLab may terminate your Account without notice to you. If your Account(s) are
                terminated, you are not entitled to a refund for any fees you have paid, and you will lose access to
                Entitlements associated with your Account.</p>

            <p>GlassLab reserves the right (but has no obligation except as required by law) to modify, remove, block,
                edit, move or disable UGC for any reason, including when GlassLab determines that UGC violates these
                terms. The decision to remove UGC or other Content at any time is in GlassLab's sole and final
                discretion. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, GlassLab does not assume any
                responsibility or liability for UGC or for removal of, UGC or any failure to or delay in removing, UGC
                or other Content.</p>
            <br/>

            <h4>7. UGC License Grant to GlassLab and Others </h4>

            <p>When you contribute UGC to an GlassLab Service, you expressly grant to GlassLab and its licensors a
                non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, complete, sub-licensable and irrevocable right to quote, re-post,
                publish, use, adapt, translate, archive, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from,
                syndicate, license, print, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, and otherwise communicate, and
                publicly display and perform the UGC, or any portion thereof, in any manner or form and in any medium or
                forum, whether now known or hereafter devised, without notice, payment or attribution of any kind to you
                or any third party. You grant GlassLab and its licensors all licenses, consents and clearances to enable
                GlassLab and its licensors to use such UGC for such purposes. You waive and agree not to assert any
                moral or similar rights you may have in such UGC.</p>

            <p>If the GlassLab Service on which you contribute UGC permits other users to access and use that UGC as
                part of the GlassLab Service, then you also grant all other users of the relevant GlassLab Service the
                right to use, copy, modify, display, perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise communicate
                and distribute your UGC on or through the relevant GlassLab Service without further notice, attribution
                or compensation to you. </p>
            <br/>

            <h4>8. Paid Services </h4>

            <p>Some GlassLab Services require payment of a fee. You must have an Account and pay the subscription and/or
                other fees to participate in these activities. For information about subscription and other fees for
                particular services, visit <a href="https://www.glasslabgames.org/subscribe/packages">https://www.glasslabgames.org/subscribe/packages.</a>
            </p>

            <p>GlassLab reserves the right to change our fees or billing methods at any time. GlassLab will always
                provide you with notice of any changes to the fees or billing methods at least thirty (30) days in
                advance by posting such changes on the GlassLab Service. You are responsible for reviewing the GlassLab
                Service to obtain timely notice of such changes. Your continued use of the GlassLab Service thirty (30)
                days or more after posting of the changes means that you accept such changes. If any change is
                unacceptable to you, you may cancel your subscription at any time, but GlassLab will not refund any fees
                that may have accrued to your Account before cancellation of your subscription, and we will not prorate
                fees for any subscription. If your use of GlassLab Services is subject to use or sales tax, then
                GlassLab may also charge you for any such taxes, in addition to the subscription or other fees. For
                further information, visit <a href="https://www.glasslabgames.org/subscribe/packages">https://www.glasslabgames.org/subscribe/packages.</a>
            </p>

            <p>If you upgrade or change your account you may be entitled to credit which can be applied to future
                purchases. However, if you choose not to renew your subscription or make future purchases on the site,
                that remaining credit will not be refunded to you.</p>

            <p>A. <strong>Payment Options</strong>. You may pay fees using the methods available for the particular
                GlassLab Service and you agree to the terms and conditions applicable to each payment method you choose.
                Payment methods may vary by GlassLab Service. When you provide credit card or other payment information
                to GlassLab, you represent to GlassLab that you are the authorized user of the credit card or other
                payment method. You must provide current, complete, and accurate information for your billing account.
                You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete, and accurate
                (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you
                should notify GlassLab if your credit card is canceled (for example, for loss or theft). Changes to such
                information can be made by contacting Customer Service at <a href="mailto:support@glasslabgames.org">support@glasslabgames.org</a>.
                GlassLab reserves the right to utilize third party credit card updating services to obtain current
                expiration dates on credit cards provided by you to GlassLab. </p>

            <p>As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all
                purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends and authorized
                users, where applicable. </p>

            <p>B. <strong>Trial Subscriptions</strong>. For some GlassLab Services, GlassLab may offer a free trial
                subscription. If you accept a free trial subscription, your subscription will end upon the trial date
                unless you elect to pay for the subscription. You are always responsible for any internet service
                provider, telephone, wireless, connection, or other fees that you may incur when using GlassLab
                Services, even when we offer a free trial subscription. Trial subscriptions are not transferrable.</p>

            <p>C. <strong>Fees Charged By Third-Party Sites and Vendors</strong>. We may provide links to other web
                sites. Some of these web sites may charge separate fees, which are not included in any subscription or
                other fees that you may pay to GlassLab. Any separate charges or obligations that you incur in your
                dealings with third parties are your responsibility.</p>
            <br/>

            <h4>9. Termination of GlassLab Services </h4>

            <p>GlassLab may terminate access to any online or mobile products and/or GlassLab Services (and/or any
                portion thereof) at any time by giving you notice of such termination within the time period specified
                when you joined the particular GlassLab Service, or if no time period for notice of termination was
                specified, then within thirty (30) days of the date such notice is either (at GlassLab&rsquo;s
                discretion) provided to you via email or is posted on the applicable product or on <a
                        href="https://www.glasslabgames.org">https://www.glasslabgames.org.</a></p>

            <p>GlassLab may also terminate access to GlassLab Services for violation of this Terms of Service, if
                GlassLab (in its sole discretion) deems that your use of GlassLab Services renders GlassLab Services
                less safe for others or for illegal or improper use of GlassLab Services, Content, Entitlement,
                products, or GlassLab's Intellectual Property as determined by GlassLab in its sole discretion. You may
                lose your user name and Account as a result of termination. If you have more than one (1) Account or
                multiple users under one (1) Account, GlassLab may terminate all of your Accounts or all of your users
                and all related Entitlements. </p>

                Content and Entitlements available through GlassLab Services or any change in Content or Entitlements
                provided through GlassLab Services; (3) your ability to access and/or use GlassLab Services and/or any
                Content or Entitlements thereon; or (4) the amount or type of fees, surcharges, applicable taxes,
